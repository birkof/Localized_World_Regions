The Localizations folder contains JSON encoded files with relevant regions. Regions 
are defined as areas within the country i.e. counties, states, provinces, emirates etc.

Each file is named after the ISO code of each country. 

The contents of each file will contain:

- Empty JSON file: if the country does not have any regions
- JSON file with one region
    -- elements are formatted ISO code => Region name
- JSON file with one region and subregions
    -- elements are formatted ISO code => Region name

Examples:

Empty:
{
}

{
    "state":{
        "AZ":"Arizona",
        ...
        "WV":"West Virginia"
    }
